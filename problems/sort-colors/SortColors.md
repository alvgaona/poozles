# Sort Colors

Given an array with `n` objects colored red, white or blue, sortg them in-place so that objects of the same color are
adjacent, with the colors in order red, white, and blue.

Here we will use integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white and blue respectively.

Note: You are not supposed to use the library's sort function for this problem.

*Example*

    Input: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
    Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
